Our business specializes in vintage clothing and we understand the challenges that come with pricing research. To solve this problem, we have developed a tool that makes the process 10X faster. We believe this tool can be of tremendous value to anyone in the vintage clothing industry and we want to share it with you. Our software integrates directly with the eBay, allowing you to easily upload your priced products and list them for sale on eBay with a single click. This not only saves you time, but also reduces operational costs significantly.

We pull data on similar vintage clothing items and use this data to make pricing recommendations for our users. This will not only save them time, but also ensure they are pricing their items competitively.

We comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to taxes and consumer protection, when allowing our users to connect to eBay to sell items. 

We are committed to protecting our users' data and will follow best practices for data security and privacy.
