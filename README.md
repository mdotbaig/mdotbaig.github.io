One of our co-founders founded and built a successful vintage clothing business that currently fulfills 3000+ orders per month (and growing!), so we thoroughly understand the challenges that come with pricing research. To solve this problem, we developed a tool that makes the process 10X faster - optimizing for efficiency of operations. We believe this tool can be of tremendous value to anyone in the vintage clothing industry and we want to share it with you. Our software integrates directly with eBay, allowing you to easily upload your priced products and list them for sale on eBay with a single click. This will not only save you time, but also reduce operational costs. 

Through years of experience as operators, we have developed a research algorithm which we've incorporated into our tool to pull *useful* data on similar vintage clothing items and we use this data to make pricing recommendations for our users. This will not only save them time, but also ensure they are pricing their items competitively to improve the likely-hood of a sale.
