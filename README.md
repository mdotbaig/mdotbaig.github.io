We've developed a tool that makes product pricing research 10X faster for vintage clothing businesses.

Our team possesses a strategic blend of technical know-how and hands-on experience in the vintage clothing industry. One of our co-founders, in particular, has a demonstrated success in the vintage clothing business, having established a company that successfully fulfills over 3000+ orders per month. Through years of experience, we have understood the challenges that come with pricing products and have developed our tool to solve this problem.

Our software integrates directly with eBay, allowing you to easily upload your priced products and list them for sale on eBay with a single click. Not only will this save you time, but it will also reduce operational costs.

Our proprietary process enables us to identify the most closely matching vintage clothing items and extract the essential data. We then use this data to make optimal pricing recommendations for our users. This ensures that they are pricing their items competitively to increase the likelihood of a sale.

We believe that this tool can be of tremendous value to anyone in the vintage and pre-loved clothing industry and we are excited to share it with you. Let our experience and success work for you. With our tool, you can improve your pricing research process and increase your chances of making a sale.
